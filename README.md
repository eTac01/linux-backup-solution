# 🔐 Data Backup Scheme Implementation in Linux

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **reliable and automated backup scheme** in Linux.  
It leverages:
- **Rsync** → for efficient file synchronization and backups  
- **Cron** → for scheduling periodic backups  
- **SSH** → for secure data transfer  

The solution ensures **data integrity, availability, and resilience** against accidental loss or corruption.  
It was developed as part of an academic project submitted to **L&T EduTech**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Develop a **functional backup scheme** for Linux in a controlled environment.  
- Demonstrate **rsync-based backups** for directories/files.  
- Automate backups with **cron jobs**.  
- Test **reliability, error handling, and recovery**.  
- Document the **setup, findings, and recommendations**.  

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Environment Setup**
   - VirtualBox / VMware for test environment  
   - Linux (CentOS) as server and client  
   - Network-attached storage (NAS) for backup  

2. **Implementation**
   - Rsync for incremental backups  
   - Cron for scheduling daily/weekly/monthly jobs  
   - SSH for secure transfers  

3. **Testing**
   - Full, incremental, and partial restore  
   - Error handling (storage, permission, connectivity issues)  
   - Verification of data integrity and completeness

## 🖥️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/data-backup-linux.git
   cd data-backup-linux

2. Configure backup.sh:

   Edit the script with your source, destination, and server IP.

3. Run a Manual Backup:
      bash src/backup.sh

4. Schedule with Cron:

   Open crontab:

      crontab -e


      Example (daily at 1 AM):

      0 1 * * * bash /path/to/backup.sh

📊 Findings

   -> Rsync transfers completed within allocated time.

   -> Backups remained unaffected even after deletion from the source.

   -> Scheduling worked smoothly using cron jobs.

   -> Scalability was validated using multiple Linux systems.

⚠️ Security Considerations

   -> Potential exploitation risks:

   -> Unauthorized access

   -> MITM attacks during transfer

   -> Injection of malicious code into backups

✅ Recommendations

   -> Use AES-256 encryption for backup data.

   -> Implement role-based access control & MFA.

   -> Regularly patch backup systems.

   -> Segment networks with firewalls & IDS/IPS.

   -> Conduct regular vulnerability assessments.
